/**
 * Created by 127.0.0.1.ma on 15/10/17.
 * <p>
 * Find out the minimum number of dockyards needed in Ironmanâ€™s bay to make room for all ships that are going to arrive.
 * <p>
 * Note: Each dockyard can accommodate only one ship at a time.
 * <p>
 * The time for the arrival and departure of ships will be in 24 hour format.All ships will arrive and depart on the same day starting from 0000hrs to 2359hrs.
 * Also note that all timings are on the same day as well!
 * <p>
 * Sample Input Format
 * <p>
 * The first line of input contains an integer T which indicates the number of test cases.
 * The first line of each test case contains an integer N which indicates the number of ships that are going to arrive.
 * Then N lines follow containing the arrival and the departure time of the ships in hhmm format.
 * Then the next test case follows with the input as described above.
 * Sample Output Format
 * <p>
 * Output the minimum number of docks that are to be built in order to accomodate all the ships for each test case.
